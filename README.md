## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

When I was thinking about an html structure for a rating solution, I decided to use the radio input because it seems to me to be the most logical html element for this. It is used for multiple choices, only one of which can be selected at a time.

I have learned how label and input elements can be visually merged so that the design specification is fulfilled and accessibility is also taken into account.

### Useful resources

- [Accessible Rating Radio Input](https://www.putzisan.com/articles/accessible-star-rating-radio-input-html-css) - This helped me for creating an accessible radio input.
